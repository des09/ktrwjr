ktrwjr is a JUnit runner web application for GAE/j.<br>
It helps to run your tests on the Production Server and the Development Server.

Haven't you ever wanted to execute your tests on the Production Server?<br>
With ktrwjr, you can do it easily.

=Features=
 * You can run your tests on both the Production Server and the Development Server.
 * When the test fails, you can see the error information.
 * You can see the real time, the CPU time and the API CPU time that the test took.
 * You can see the logs which is outputed during the running of the test.

 * Supports JUnit4 & JUnit3
 * I confirmed ktrwjr works well with IE8/FF3/Chrome10 on WinXP (I won't support IE6 & IE7).
 * Using GWT & jQueryUI Theme.

If you deploy ktrwjr with your GAE/j application, you can run your tests on the Production Server.<br>
(You can also run your tests on the Development Server.)

=How It Works?=
ktrwjr is a simple web application.
 # When you open the ktrwjr page, ktrwjr searches tests on the server and shows them.
 # You check test cases that you want to run, then click "Run" button.
 # They are run on the server and you receive results.
