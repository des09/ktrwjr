=What Is Kotori Web JUnit Runner(ktrwjr)?=
ktrwjr is a JUnit runner web application for GAE/j.<br>
It helps to run your tests on the Production Server and the Development Server.

Haven't you ever wanted to execute your tests on the Production Server?<br>
With ktrwjr, you can do it easily. 

=Demonstration=
http://ktrwjr.appspot.com/

=Features=
 * You can run your tests on both the Production Server and the Development Server.
 * When the test fails, you can see the failure trace.
 * You can see the real time, the CPU time and the API CPU time that the test took.
 * You can see the logs which is outputed during the running of the test.

 * Supports Java6 & Java5
 * Supports JUnit4 & JUnit3
 * I confirmed ktrwjr works well with IE8/FF3/Chrome5 on WinXP (I won't support IE6 & IE7).
 * Using GWT & jQueryUI Theme.

If you deploy ktrwjr with your GAE/j application, you can run your tests on the Production Server.<br>
(You can also run your tests on the Development Server.)

=How It Works?=
ktrwjr is a simple web application.
 # When you open the ktrwjr page, ktrwjr searches tests on the server and shows them.
 # You check test cases that you want to run, then click "Run" button.
 # They are run on the server and you receive results.

=How Do I Use It?=
==Step1: download zip==
Download the latest ktrwjr-x.x.x.zip(x.x.x is the version) from [http://code.google.com/p/ktrwjr/downloads/list Downloads].

==Step2: copy files to your war=
Unzip and copy files in the war directory to your application's war directory.

==Step3: edit your web.xml=
Add the following to your web.xml.
{{{
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>KtrWjrServiceServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>bufferings.ktr.wjr.server.service.KtrWjrServiceServlet</servlet-class>
  </servlet>

  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>KtrWjrServiceServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/ktrwjr/ktrwjr/ktrwjr.s3gwt</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
}}}

==Step4: security constraint==
It is better to lock down the ktrwjr urls so that only admin users can access to.

Add the following to your web.xml.
{{{
  <security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
      <url-pattern>/ktrwjr/*</url-pattern>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <auth-constraint>
      <role-name>admin</role-name>
    </auth-constraint>
  </security-constraint>
}}}

==Step5: add gwt-servlet.jar==
Add "gwt-servlet.jar" into your "war/WEB-INF/lib" if there's not.<br>
The library is in GWT sdk.<br>
If you use Google Plugin for Eclipse, the GWT sdk is in the plugins folder.

==Step6: add junit.jar==
Add "junit.jar" into your "war/WEB-INF/lib" if there's not.

==Step7: check source folder output==
ktrwjr searches tests in "WEB-INF/classes" directory.<br>
If the output folder of the test source folder is not war/WEB-INF/classes,<br>
change it to war/WEB-INF/classes.

In case of Eclipse
 # Open property dialog of your project
 # Select "Java Build Path" from left tree
 # Select "Source" tab
 # Uncheck "Allow output folders for source folders"

==That's all.==
First, launch the Development Server and access to "/ktrwjr/index.html".<br>
After checking it goes well on dev-server, deploy to the Production Server.<br>
Enjoy ktrwjr testing!

=Notice=
==30 Seconds Limitation==
ktrwjr simply runs test, so a test which takes more than 30 seconds will fail because of GAE limitation.

If you want to run such tests, following project may be useful.<br>
I don't know about that well, it seems to use Task Queue.

==Servlet Call==
ktrwjr calls servlet once on load.<br>
After that, it calls once for running one test.<br>
Excluding those, it does not call servlet.

==Development Server Log Hook==
ktrwjr hooks logging messages during the test running.<br>
The way of the log hook is different between the Production Server and the Development Server.<br>
On the Production Server, ktrwjr can hook all logs during the test running.<br>
On the other hand, on the Development Server, ktrwjr can only hook the logs of the LoggingAPI.

=Options=
==Log !TimeZone on ktrwjr==
You can specify the log time zone to display on ktrwjr.
 # Specify the GET parameter "tz" like "?tz=JST" at the end of the URL.
 # If you have already opened ktrwjr, reload ktrwjr.

==jQueryUI Theme==
You can apply your favorite [http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ jQueryUI Theme].<br>
The distribution zip includes the "base" theme, but you can use what you like.
 # Download a jQueryUI Theme you like.
 # Put the theme in "war/ktrwjr/css".
 # Change the css file reference in "war/ktrwjr/index.html" to the new one.
